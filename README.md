# e-commerce-framework
A basic back-end construction of a generalized e-commerce architecture

## Overview
This application utilises node, express, MySQL database, mysql2 module, and and sequelize to host and route data for a simplified e-commerce back-end.  Using an a API testing tool, such as Insomnia or Postman, we can test our "CRUD" routes for three distinct databases: Products, their Categories, and their Tags.
